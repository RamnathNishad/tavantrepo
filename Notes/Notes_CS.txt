using command line tool for .net core application development:-

basic types:- 
a) value-types:-
predefined:
int,char,double,float,decimal,datetime,long,byte,uint,short,boolean and so on
user-defined types:-
-enum
-struct


b) reference types:-
predefined:string
user-defined types:-
-arrays
-classes
-interfaces


Arrays:-
-single-dimension:-
-multi-dimension:-
	-i)Rectangular  array: a particular dimension will have same number of items
	ii)Jagged array:- a dimension may have different number of items

--Data-conversions:-
1) value-to-value :- lower to higher(implicit) but higher to lower precision (explicit) as data loss may happen
2) value-to-reference:- boxing
3) reference-to-value:- unboxing
4) reference-to-reference:- base to derived or vice-versa


==============Convert vs Parse vs TryParse========================
1) Convert :- will give error is string is invalid and gives default value 0 if string null else
success conevrsion
2) TryParse:- if string is invalid it gives default value and if null also gives default value else true if successfull converision
3) Parse:- if string valid then successfull conversion, if string is null or invalid,it gives exception ArgumentNullExcpetion and FormatException respectively

==================DateTime parsing===================



===================static modifier======================
it is a modifier which indicates the member of a class is not meant for its instances.
it is allocated once per class not per instance.
so it is accessed also using class name.

static method can only access static member(methods n fields) but non-static methods can access
both static as well as non static members also.

static can be called class name only.



====================out vs ref=================
Normally value-type variables are passed to a method by-value and objects are passed by-reference by default.
If we want to pass value-type variables also by-reference to a method, we can use out or ref keyword.
out: we use when the modification of the parameter is mandatory before leaving the method
ref:- optional modification of the parameter inside the method passed.


====================const vs readonly=====================
const:- is declared and assigned at the same time and cannot be changed till its scope is there.
readonly:- can be assigned only through constructor method i.e. one time assignment. later cannot be modified.



Q. Create an array for the cinema hall tickets of 25 by 25 seats.
User enters the number of seats to be booked. Once booking is successfull, the seat should be marked as 1. For e.g. if the user enter 2 seats to be booked, then seat[0][0]=1 and seat[0][1]=1 should be assigned. If number of tickets is unavailable, it should display error.
After booking, all the seats should be displayed on screen which should show 0 in free seats and 1 in booked seats.








OOPs:-
1) Abstraction:-  
ecommerce----customer----->car,family, cid,cname,contactno,billing address, pincode
employee----> ecode,ename,salary,emailid 

2) Encapsulation:- putting all the related things together

relations:-
3.1) Inheritance:- 
	kind-of or is-a relations
3.2) Aggregation/Composition:- part-of or has-a relation
	Aggregation:- contained objects still exist even if their container is not there
	Composition:- if the container is not their, contained object also does not exists
			Policy---->Nominee

	cardinality ratio:
		1:1-----> COURSE------LECTURER
		1:m---->DEPARTMENT----->EMPLOYEE
		m:1---->
		m:n---->STUDENT------>COURSE
 


4) Polymorphism:- One object behaves differently in different situations
	servant----->cook,watchman,tutor
a) static polymorphism:- overloading of the method. binding of the object to a type is pre-decided during compilation and cannot be changed to other type at runtime.
	
b) dynamic polymorphism:-	overriding of the methods across inheritance. binding of the object is decided at runtime
