Cascading Style Sheet:-
-Html has limited attributes for styling and extensive styles and decorations if it is needed CSS can be used. It also separates the content from the styling which makes easier in maintaining the web pages in future.
More sharing and reusability of the styles are achived using CSS.
Three ways to use css in ur page:
1) inline CSS:- it is private to an html element by using an attribute "style"
e.g.
	<p style="color:red;background-color:yellow"> Para1</p>
	<p> Para2</style>

2) Embedded CSS:- it is defined in <style> tag under <head> element and it is meant for the whole page for that type of element.
syntax=>
	<head>
	<style>
	p{
		color:red;
	}
	</style>
	</head>

3) external CSS:- It is defined in a separate .css file and wherever it is needed, it is linked the
page using <link href="file.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />.  This link is to be defined
under the <head> tag
	file.css:-
		p{
			color:red;
		}

4) CSS class:- it  is defined using dot(.) with some name. It has got more sharing as it is independent of type element which can use it. i.e. it can be used by any elements.
syntax=>
	.c1{
		color:red;
	}
	.c2{
		background-color:red;
	}

use:
	<p class="c1 c2">Hello</p>
	<h1 class="c1">Welcome</h1>
